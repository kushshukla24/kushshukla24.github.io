# Chapter 1 - The Will

I was born and raised in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Since childhood, I had heard about disputes over ancestral property among the heirs, conflicts between tenants and homeowners, and cases of adverse possession of land. These kinds of events were common in our locality, and they were the source of many hushed conversations at any common gatherings. However, I personally never paid much attention to these matters because they didn't directly impact me. I was in school, singularly focused on my studies, driven by the aspiration of building a brighter future for myself and my family. My family, too, shielded me from any involvement in these discussions, preferring to protect me from the legal complexities often associated with property disputes.

As I grew up, I graduated and eventually found employment in the IT sector outside my hometown. Life in the corporate world appeared promising, and I was content with the path I had chosen. However, fate has a curious way of reminding you of your roots. It was an ordinary morning on the **10th of April 2018** when I received a call from my father. He informed me about a shocking incident that had unfolded at our ancestral home in Kanpur—a robbery in broad daylight, perpetrated by individuals in the locality with support from relatives who believed they had a stake in the property. The incident shook me to the core, making me realize that I could no longer remain oblivious to the property disputes that had long haunted my family. This drove me to initiate conversations, seek legal understanding, consult experts, and take actions towards resolution. It was during this time that I came to learn about **the will**, a document of immense importance in our ongoing property dispute, which my father had in his possession.

## Background Story and the Case
My father possessed an **unregistered** will dated **June 15, 1958**. This will was drafted by my great-grandfather with the help of an advocate and bears his signature, along with the signatures of two witnesses and the advocate, along with the advocate's stamp. In 1999, my father obtained this will through a relative who is the son of one of the two witnesses to the will.

With the will in his possession, my father initiated the process of mutating the property's ownership based on its contents. However, his efforts faced a roadblock when both the Kanpur Development Authority and Kanpur Nagar Nigam didn't act upon the mutation application. When followed up on the application with the officials, they informally verbally cited the issue that the will was not registered, and hence we cannot proceed with the mutation. This left us at a crossroads, uncertain about how to proceed.

At this juncture, my father sought advice from relatives and a trusted advocate who had experience in such matters. Their counsel was consistent - there was no immediate urgency to pursue property mutation since we were  already residing in the ancestral property, and there were no intentions of selling it or realizing capital gains in the near future. With this guidance in mind, my father decided not to pursue the mutation any further at that time, putting it on the back burner as we continued to live in the property.

Numerous incidents, comprising both verbal altercations and physical confrontations, serve as clear evidence of my uncles' continual threats aimed at my father. These threats were consistently centered on their plan to sell the property to local goons, seeking financial gain while simultaneously intending to forcefully expel my father from his rightful possession of the premises. A particularly unsettling threat occurred on **April 8, 2018**, during which my uncles not only subjected us to verbal abuse but also issued explicit warnings, compelling us to vacate the property under duress. Adding to the gravity of the situation, they disclosed that they had already sold their respective portions to a locally known individual involved in illicit activities. Fearing that our ancestral property was under threat, on **April 9, 2018**, he took a decisive step and, after consulting a senior lawyer, initiated an **Original Suit** to assert his ownership rights. Since that pivotal moment, a flurry of paperwork has transpired between the involved parties, and the legal proceedings have been transferred among different jurisdictions. Yet, despite all these legal intricacies, the linchpin of this entire dispute, **"The Will"**, which, in my view, holds the key to determining rightful ownership, remains unaddressed and unresolved. 


## Analysis
This revelation about the unregistered will marked the beginning of my intricate legal journey. As the property dispute escalated within the court of law, I embarked on a mission to navigate the complexities of property law, with the overarching goal of finding a resolution for the property dispute and securing peace of mind for both myself and my family.


Let's delve into the key points and facts of the case:
- There is an **original Will** that exists, dated **15th June 1958**, making it more than **60 years old**.
- **The Will** is unregistered.
- The testator, the two witnesses, and the advocate whose names appear on the Will are all deceased.
- There exists a Lease Deed of the Property from **16th June 1950**, bearing the signature of the testator.

On the opposing side of this legal skirmish, the parties contesting our claim assert that the Will is nothing more than a false, fictitious, forged, and fabricated document. Their claims, while vehement, appear to lack substantial proof, and it seems convenient for them to assert the Will's invalidity simply because it serves their interests. This challenge, however, served as a catalyst for me to delve into the intricacies of Indian law, determined to establish the validity of the Will as a crucial piece of evidence for our case.

Through extensive research, I uncovered the pertinent sections of the Indian Acts applicable in the jurisdiction of Kanpur that are vital to our case. These sections will serve as our guiding light as we seek to prove the authenticity and legality of **the Will**, thus bolstering our claim to rightful ownership. I have outlined the relevant Indian legal provisions and my interference w.r.t this case below:

#### 1. Section 18 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908, Section 68 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925: 

These sections states that registration of a Will is not mandatory and Will is not invalid because it is not registered.

**Reference Cases and Verdict**:
1. **Baldev Singh v. Jaswant Singh (1960 AIR 458)**, the Supreme Court of India held that an unregistered Will is valid if it complies with the requirements of Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925.
2. **Nirmaljit Singh v. Harbhajan Kaur (1992 AIR 499)**, the Supreme Court of India held that the registration of a Will is a matter of convenience and not of validity.
Harish Chandra vs. Prem Parkash (AIR 2000 SC 3993): The Supreme Court of India held that an unregistered will is still valid as long as it meets all the other requirements for a valid will.
3. **Smt. Sushila Devi v. Smt. Jai Narayan (AIR 2007 SC 1805)**, the Supreme Court held that the fact that a Will is unregistered does not affect its validity.

**My Inference:** 

The unregistered nature of the Will, should not have posed a problem in the process of property mutation, as it is, in fact, a valid and legally recognized document. This aspect should have been duly considered by the Kanpur Development Authority and Nagar Nigam when evaluating our request for property mutation. Nonetheless, it's essential to emphasize that the Will remains perfectly valid in the court of law and should be acknowledged as a crucial piece of evidence in our case. Despite its unregistered status, the Will bears substantial weight in our pursuit of establishing our rightful ownership of the ancestral property. 

#### 2. Section 57 and 63 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872: 

These section states that a Will must be in writing and signed by the testator (the person making the Will) or by some other person in his presence and by his direction. The Will must also be attested by two or more witnesses.

**Reference Cases and Verdict:**
1. **Ramchandra Mishra v. Lachmi Devi (AIR 1964 SC 1080)**, the Supreme Court held that an unregistered Will is as valid as a registered Will, provided that it meets the other requirements of a valid Will.

**My Inference:**

The original Will, is composed using a typewriter in the Hindi language and carries the signature of the Testator, two witnesses and the advocate who drafted the Will. This key detail unequivocally establishes the Will's validity and authenticity under the Indian legal framework. The fact that it was composed using a typewriter, stamped with Advocate seal and is penned in the language understood by the Testator bolsters its legal standing. 

#### 3. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872:

This section provides that documents must be proved by primary evidence before secondary evidence can be admitted. 

**Reference Cases and Verdict:**

1. **Rajinder Kumar v. Smt. Krishna Rani, AIR 1998 P&H 167**, the Punjab and Haryana High Court held that an unregistered Will is as valid as a registered Will, provided that it is proved by satisfactory evidence. The Court also held that the death of the witnesses does not prevent the Will from being proved.
2. **Smt. Prem Rani v. Smt. Krishna Devi, 2009 (3) DRJ (HP) 3**, the Himachal Pradesh High Court held that an unregistered Will is as valid as a registered Will, provided that it is proved by satisfactory evidence. The Court also held that the death of the witnesses does not prevent the Will from being proved.
3. **Smt. Ram Kaur v. Smt. Parkash Kaur, 2011 (1) DRJ (P&H) 126**, the Punjab and Haryana High Court held that an unregistered Will is as valid as a registered Will, provided that it is proved by satisfactory evidence. The Court also held that the death of the witnesses does not prevent the Will from being proved.

**My Inference:** 

**The Original Will** stands as the primary evidence and the authoritative source of the testator's intention and wishes.
Additionally, the presence of a Lease Deed of the property in records further strengthens our position. This Lease Deed contains reference signatures of the testator and is documented in the official government property records as well. The existence of this reference document in official records adds an extra layer of credibility and authenticity to the Will, reinforcing its status as a valid legal instrument.
To bolster the already substantial primary evidence, a handwriting analysis of the testator's signature should provide another layer of assurance regarding the authenticity and validity of the Will. 

#### 4. Section 69 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872: 
This section states that if both attesting witnesses to a will are dead, then the will can be proved by proving the handwriting of one attesting witness.

**Reference Cases and Verdict:**

1. **Janki Narayan Bhoir v. Smt. Laxmibai and Ors. (1984 AIR 1159)**, in this case, the Supreme Court held that the attestation of one attesting witness is sufficient to prove the execution of a will when both attesting witnesses are dead.
2. **J. Naval Kishore v. D. Swarna Bhadran, J. Parasmul, P. Venugopal and Ors. (2007 AIR 2899)**, in this case, the Supreme Court held that the attestation of one attesting witness is sufficient to prove the execution of an unregistered will when both attesting witnesses are dead.

**My Inference:** 

While our primary evidence should suffice to establish the authenticity and validity of the Will, it's worth considering secondary evidence, especially in a case like ours where both of the original witnesses are no longer with us. We have learned that one of the witnesses, now deceased, held a bank account with XYZ bank during their lifetime.
If deemed necessary, the court has the authority to issue an order to retrieve the signatures from the authoritative source of XYZ bank, enabling a comprehensive handwriting analysis. Such an analysis would provide an additional layer of assurance, further reinforcing the Will's legitimacy. This secondary evidence could potentially serve as a powerful corroborative measure, offering another perspective on the authenticity and intent of the testator.

#### 5. Section 65 and 72  of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872: 
This section states that the documents that are 30 years old or more and are produced from proper custody are presumed to be genuine.

**Reference Cases and Verdict:**
1. **Pulukuri Kottaya vs. Emperor (AIR 1947 PC 67)**, this landmark case established the importance of Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act. It emphasized that the provision is a valuable aid in the assessment of the genuineness of a document, particularly when it is more than 30 years old.
2. **Makhan Singh vs. State of Punjab (AIR 1973 SC 1518)**, in this case, the Supreme Court highlighted that under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, a presumption of genuineness arises when a document, more than 30 years old and produced from proper custody, is presented as evidence.
3. **Mahadeo Prasad vs. Babulal AIR 1961 SC 645**, the Supreme Court upheld the principles of Section 65 and Section 90 of the Indian Evidence Act, emphasizing that when a document is over 30 years old and produced from proper custody, there is a strong presumption of its genuineness.
4. **Chajju Ram vs. Neki (AIR 1971 SC 1367)**, in this case, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the importance of proper custody and the age of the document in determining its genuineness under Section 65.

**My Inference:**

**The Original Will**, dated **15th June 1958**, undeniably qualifies as a document that has stood the test of time, being more than 60 years old. In the eyes of the court, this document is presented by me, the heir and custodian, and by a relative who happens to be the son of one of the original witnesses to the Will. These custodial arrangements are not only legally sound but also lend an air of trustworthiness to the document's authenticity.

## Conclusion
Given these compelling facts under law, there should be minimal room for contention in the court's deliberations. The age of the document, the credible custodial arrangements, and the presence of multiple reliable sources all converge to support the claim that the Will is not only genuine but also an irreplaceable testament to the testator's wishes.
