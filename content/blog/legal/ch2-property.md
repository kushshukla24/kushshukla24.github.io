# Chapter 2 - The Property

In our previous chapetr, we delved into the significance of the Will, a crucial element in our pursuit of asserting rightful ownership of the property. In this installment, we embark on a journey through the annals of time, unraveling the series of events that have unfolded on the property, events that bear legal implications. 

## Background Story and the Case
The family hierarchy across generations unfolds as follows:
Great-grandfather GG, had two sons, G1 and G2, along with three daughters, D1, D2, and D3. Moving a generation down, G1 had three sons my father F, other (S1, S2) and three daughters (B1, B2, and B3), while G2 had one son, S3.

As of the present day, the whereabouts of D1, D2, and D3 is unknown. GG, G1, and B1 have passed away. Among the living and actively involved in the ongoing legal battle are G1, F, S1, S2, B2, and B3. 

GG acquired a plot, denoted as P, spanning 1350 square feet in Kanpur. The acquisition was formalized through a lease deed dated June 16, 1950, between the Kanpur Development Board and GG for this property. Notably, this lease deed was duly registered at the Sub-Registrar's office in Kanpur on June 29, 1950. To provide some context, at the time of this purchase, GG resided with his family in a rented house, denoted as R. Unfortunately, GG passed away on June 21, 1958, marking a pivotal moment in the timeline of the property's history.

At the time of GG's passing, S1, S2, S3, and B3 had not yet been born. Meanwhile, D1, D2, and D3 were already married and residing in their respective in-laws' homes.

GG acquired the plot, designated as **P**, at a cost of Rs 1425. For the initial payment, he made a downpayment of Rs 366 and 4 annas, with the understanding that the remaining sum would be settled through 12 six-monthly equated installments of Rs 107 and 6 annas each as per the lease deed. GG dutifully paid several installments as agreed upon. However, following his demise, notifications for the outstanding installments began arriving at the residence **R**. To honor the commitment made by his great-grandfather, my father stepped in and, using his hard-earned money, settled the remaining installments on May 8, 1970, with the Kanpur Mahanagarpalika. This act fulfilled the financial obligations tied to the property.

Questions:
1. Why was G1 not paying up for the remaining installations? Was he not financially stable?
2. What make F to pay for the remaining installations? 
3. Till when did S2 and S3 lived in the Property P?
4. When did the F made payment to S2 and S3 to leave the property?
5. Role of G1 and G2 in the property?

In 1979, my father took a significant step towards establishing a more permanent residence on P by constructing a roof of tile pantile, marking the initiation of our long-term habitation at the property. This marked the beginning of a more settled living arrangement. Fast forward to 1987, fueled by a desire to enhance our quality of life, my father further invested in the property. Using his hard-earned income, he constructed a durable pucca house on P, featuring one room, one kitchen, one bathroom, and even installed a hand-pump for convenience. The entire construction project was financed solely from his personal earnings, underlining his commitment to providing a comfortable and self-sufficient living space for our family. Additionally, my father diligently fulfilled all civic responsibilities associated with P, ensuring the timely payment of house taxes, water taxes, and electricity bills, showcasing a responsible and proactive approach to property ownership.

On August 23, 2017, when my father went to settle the dues with the Kanpur Mahanagarpalika, he was met with an unexpected revelation. It was conveyed to him that the property had undergone mutation in his name, alongside five others, a process supposedly executed on April 21, 2017. This list included S1, S2, B1, B2, and G2. What added to the shock was that this mutation had occurred without any prior knowledge or consent from my father. In response to this surprising revelation, my father took it upon himself to scrutinize the documentation that served as the basis for the property mutation. His investigation revealed a significant flaw—the information on which the mutation had been executed was incorrect, failing to accurately represent the correct family hierarchy. 

On April 9, 2018, a distressing incident unfolded. G1, accompanied by S1, S2, S3, and a few others, forcibly broke into the property, pilfered belongings from the house, and attempted to seize possession of the premises. The details of this robbery and the legal perspective is the topic to next blog post of the series. However, as we investigated this event, we uncovered a shocking revelation — G1 had allegedly sold 50% of the property, while S1 and S2 each purportedly sold 16.67% through the registration of two separate sale deeds based on the mutation done in the records of Kanpur Mahanagarpalika a year back.
