Contemporary enterprises now house a plethora of repositories, owing to the rise of microservices, which facilitate the creation and upkeep of their offerings. These repositories are frequently overseen by a range of teams, each possessing distinct workflows and regulations. The repositories exhibit variations in code scale, number of collaborators, and employed programming languages, consequently leading to a diverse array of management protocols for each repository. Handling these repositories can prove to be an overwhelming endeavor, particularly when dealing with a substantial and heterogeneous repository count.

This demands a need for a bot that can centrally manage these repositories and enforce custom workflows.
