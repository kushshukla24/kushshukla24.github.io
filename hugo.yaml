    intro: "Hi, I'm,"
    title: "Kush,"
    subtitle: "a software architect"
    content: |- 
      passionate about developing systems, tools, and processes
      centered around catering business needs focussed on generating value.
      I champion platform philosophy and provide value by driving 
      end-to-end implementations and driving the adoption by the consumers.

      I prefer:
      - **Architecting systems for scale with 3-5 years horizon** over 10+ years horizon.
      - **Iterative solution capable of faster GTM** over perfect one-shot product.
      - **Exploiting existing tools** over reinventing the wheel.
      - **Meaningful abstractions** over magical illusions.
      - **Readable Code** over subtle optimizations.
      - **Business driven code modularization** over component driven modularity.
      - **Investing** over trading.
      - **Automation** over grunt work.
      - **Learning** over stagnation.
      
      I keep an eye on the latest trends in technology projects and try to keep myself abreast by taking courses, reading blogs and tinkering with the stuff.

    title: "About Me"
    image: "/profile2.jpeg"
    content: |-
      I possess 13+ years of experience in building robust enterprise-grade 
      software solutions for high-volume businesses.

      A typical day in my professional capacity involves interacting with consumers, 
      architecting systems, engaging in long discussions on ideas and technology with 
      colleagues and fellow architects, writing code, performing code reviews, mentoring, 
      and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

      Apart from my professional life, I enjoy learning and applying my knowledge through 
      useful hands-on projects. 
      I have developed few systems for personal use to assist with my investment decisions, 
      fitness, nutrition, and home automation.

      I pursue these interests by continuously engaging with courses, books, blogs, and 
      hands-on projects. 
      I have completed 100+ courses on various MOOC platforms in a wide variety of subjects (anything I find relevant and applicable).
